# Chess-Game-Python-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a chess game with an AI opponent using the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The game is designed to be played through the command line interface, allowing users to make moves against the computer opponent.

## Features
### Chess Game Implementation:

The repository includes a complete implementation of a chess game that adheres to the standard rules.
Players can make moves, and the computer opponent uses the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine its moves.
### Interactive Command Line Interface:

The game features a user-friendly command line interface that displays the chessboard and pieces after each move.
Players can input their moves using standard chess notation (e.g., e2 to e4).
### Move Tracking:

The game keeps track of all moves made by both players, providing a comprehensive record of the gameplay.
### Checkmate and Stalemate Detection:

The game detects checkmate, declaring the winner when a player successfully captures the opponent's king.
Stalemate conditions are also recognized, resulting in a draw.
## Getting Started
* Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-minimax-alphabeta.git
* Run the Game:

Open the Jupyter Notebook file containing the chess game implementation.
Execute the notebook cells to play the game.
## How to Play
### Player Moves:

Enter your moves using standard chess notation (e.g., e2 to e4).
The game will display the updated chessboard after each move.
### Computer Opponent:

The computer opponent utilizes the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make intelligent moves.
### Game Outcome:

The game will declare the winner when a player achieves checkmate.
Stalemate conditions will result in a draw.
